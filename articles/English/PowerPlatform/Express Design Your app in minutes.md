## Express Design
Announced at Microsoft Build 2022 Express Design can speed up app development and POC creation. It translates notes, pictures or just a handwritten piece of paper to a fully fledged app, and then allows you to modify it further to better suit your needs.
<br/>
<br/>
## How does Express Design work?
Express Design accepts a broad range of inputs. It can work with PDFs, sketches on the whiteboard, a screenshot of a UI from a legacy app, or Figma - tool for professional asset design. The one I loved the most, though, is the paper form. All you need to do, is sketch your idea for an app on a piece of paper, and then take a picture of your design. Express Design reads the information from the picture and turns it into an app.

## Updating your legacy apps
Express Design can also help you update old legacy apps. Take a screenshot from an old app and Express Design will create a suggestion for a new, updated, modern version.
