# Intro 


When a community is created in Viva Engage, the system generates a SharePoint site along with several other resources to support content management, engagement, and security. 

### SharePoint Site Collection

**Purpose**: The SharePoint site acts as a content repository, providing secure storage and management capabilities for files, images, and documents shared within the Viva Engage community.

**Mechanism**: A connected SharePoint site is provisioned automatically with document libraries and folders for files, media, and images, enabling a streamlined, collaborative experience where documents can be accessed, edited, and managed directly in context.

**Why**: This supports file versioning, compliance, data retention, and sharing policies set by the organization.

### Document Libraries

**Purpose**: To organize files and media shared in the Viva Engage community.
**Mechanism**: Libraries for documents, images, and other files are created within the associated SharePoint site.
**Why**: Organizing media helps ensure content is easily searchable, accessible, and manageable, especially when communities grow in scale and file-sharing increases.

### Microsoft 365 Group Creation
**Purpose**: The community is also supported by a Microsoft 365 group that grants permissions, handles membership, and offers other collaboration tools.
Mechanism: When the community is created, it also creates an M365 group, linking to other tools like Outlook (for communication), Planner (for task management), and SharePoint.
**Why**: This group provides a cohesive permission structure that spans all integrated Microsoft 365 services, so members automatically get access to all community content and resources without extra management steps.

### Permissions and Compliance Settings
**Purpose**: To ensure that the community adheres to organizational security policies.
Mechanism: The permissions of the SharePoint site and associated Microsoft 365 group are configured based on community visibility settings (e.g., public, private) and organizational guidelines.
Why: Security, privacy, and compliance are crucial, especially for sensitive discussions. These configurations also ensure that content is retained and deleted according to legal and compliance standards.

### Why hide the resources?

When you position Viva Engage Communities in your organisation, you are going to face the questions such as:

* When should I use SharePoint and when Viva Engage?
* What's the difference between Viva Engage Community and Teams chat?
* I already know Teams. What's the added value of Viva Engage?

Seeing links to SharePoint site, SharePoint library, OneNote and Planner in their Viva Engage Community can confuse the users. Some organizations choose to hide this feature to discourage users from storing excessive files within Viva Engage Communities. This helps prevent the creation of additional libraries, which could lead to storage issues over time.
