This article shows how to post an announcement in Viva Engage Community.

# Post an Announcement


In your Community start a post. Below the text click on the Announcement (loudspeaker) icon. You should see a warning message in grey below. It will tell you that this post will be immediately shared with all community members.

For email, you can choose whether it should be sent immediately. If this is a mandatory announcement and you wish to send emails immediately, **along with other notifications**, select the checkbox. Mind you, this will **include members who have opted out** of email notifications.
