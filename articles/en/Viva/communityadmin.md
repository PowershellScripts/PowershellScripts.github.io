# The heartstone of your Viva Engage Community
The Community Admin role in Viva Engage is crucial for managing and overseeing communities within the platform. This role provides a set of permissions that allow admins to shape the experience within a community, control membership, and ensure that the content aligns with the community's goals and organizational policies.

You can identify your community admins by a small star icon next to their name. You can elevate other users to community admin status by clicking on Members in the top right corner, and then three dots (...) by the person's name.

# Key Responsibilities and Permissions


### Creating and Managing the Community

* **Creation**: Viva Engage Community Admins can create new communities for specific groups, departments, or interests. They are responsible for setting the name, description, and purpose of the community.

* **Customization**: Viva Engage Community Admins can customize the community by adding a cover photo, logo, and adjusting settings that reflect the community's goals. This includes privacy settings, choosing whether the community is public or private.
Moderating Content:

* **Post Management**: Viva Engage Community Admins can delete posts that violate company policies or community guidelines. They can also pin important posts or announcements to ensure they are visible to all members.

* **Approving Members**: For private communities, Community Admins control who can join by approving or denying membership requests.

* **Tagging Important Posts**: They can highlight key posts as "announcements," ensuring that they stand out in the feed and notify all community members.

* **Reporting Issues**: Community Admins can report problematic behavior or content to higher-level admins or HR, depending on the company's structure.

### Membership Management

* **Adding or Removing Members**: Viva Engage Community Admins can manually add members to the community or remove users who no longer need access.

* **Promoting Co-Admins**: Community Admins can assign additional members as Co-Admins, sharing the responsibilities of managing the community.

### Managing Community Life Cycle

* **Access to Insights**: Viva Engage Community Admins have access to community insights, which provide data on engagement, such as the number of posts, comments, reactions, and active members. This helps track the success of the community and the level of interaction.

* **Encouraging Participation**: Admins are often responsible for keeping the community active by encouraging discussions, posting relevant content, and engaging with community members.

* **Announcements**: Community Admins can send community-wide announcements that notify all members through email and Viva Engage notifications, ensuring important messages are not missed.

* **Notification Settings**: They can help guide users on how to manage notifications to avoid overload while ensuring that critical information reaches the right people.

* **Archiving or Deleting the Community**: If a community is no longer active or needed, the Community Admin has the authority to archive or delete the community. This can also be in line with organizational governance policies around inactive communities.

* **Managing Privacy Settings**: Community Admins set whether a community is public (anyone in the organization can join) or private (membership must be approved).

# Community Admin vs Viva Engage Admin

While Community Admins have a lot of control over their specific community, they do not have access to platform-wide settings or administrative rights outside of their designated communities. Global Admins or Viva Engage Admins have broader authority across the entire organization.
