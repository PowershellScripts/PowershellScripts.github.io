<h1>Step 1: Keep it clean, close your Viva conversations</h1> <a name="closeVivaconversations"></a>

There is a variety of reasons why you should be closing Viva Engage conversations

*<b>Completion of Purpose:</b> If a conversation has achieved its goal, such as resolving a problem or answering a question, it can be closed to indicate that no further contributions are needed.

*<b>Moderation:</b> Moderators or administrators might close conversations if they find that the discussion is deviating from guidelines, is inappropriate, or violates any policies.

*<b>Preventing Information Overload:</b> In active groups or teams, conversations might be closed to maintain clarity and ensure that important information isn't lost in long, ongoing threads.

*<b>Archiving:</b> Older conversations can be closed to archive them. This helps to separate current discussions from those that have been concluded, making the platform more organized.

*<b>Project Completion:</b> In project-related groups, conversations might be closed once a project is finished and no further discussion is necessary.

Conversations that no longer 
Before the rollout, only a post creator can close conversations in Storyline and only the Community admins can close conversations on behalf of members in Communities. We are expanding the ability for delegates, delegate managers, Global admins, and Engage Admins to moderate Viva Engage content. 
Delegates and delegate managers will be able to close conversations on behalf of the delegator, and Global and Engage admins will be able to close conversations on behalf of any content creator. This capability will be available in both Communities and in support of our psychological safety goals.
Conversations may also be reopened. Delegates (with Storyline access) only may reopen the conversation for their delegators on Storyline. Global and Engage admins will be able to reopen conversations in Communities and on Storyline.
