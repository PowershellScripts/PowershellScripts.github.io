Now, you can post on behalf of another person in Viva Engage. This feature allows Viva Engage users to assign a delegate who can post on behalf of them. Users can configure it through Yammer's settings section.

<br/><br/>

<h1>Set up your delegate</h1>
In the top right corner of your screen there is a gear icon that will take you to the Viva Engage settings. You can add multiple delegates and you can have up to 20 delegates.

Choose between:
* Delegate who can post on your behalf
* Delegate Manager who can post on your behalf and manage other delegates.

It may take a couple of minutes for the permissions to kick in. 

<br/><br/><br/>

<h1>How to post as delegate</h1>
As a delegate you can create posts on behalf of the delegating user. In order to do that see the text above the post, saying "Post as [User]" and click on your name. You should get a drop down list of all users you can post on behalf of. You can be a delegate of multiple users.

<br/><br/>
The delegates can also edit and delete posts. The delegates can also write comments in Viva Engage on other users' posts, but they cannot use reactions, such as Like.
