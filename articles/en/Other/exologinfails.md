# ExchangeOnlineManagement fails to connect
ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting ExchangeOnlineManagement Connection Issues

```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName
InvalidOperation: You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
```




When trying to connect to Exchange Online using the **Connect-ExchangeOnline** cmdlet from the ExchangeOnlineManagement PowerShell module, you might encounter the following error:

> InvalidOperation: You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.


This error typically indicates that something went wrong during the initialization of the module or authentication process. 


Check how many ExchangeOnlineManagement modules you have. If it's more than one, it is likely to cause an issue. Unless you have a very good reason to keep multiple versions, it's best to have only **one**.

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | where {$_.Name -match "Exchange"}
```

Uninstall all your modules. It will allow for a clean start.

```powershell
Uninstall-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -force
```

Make sure all are uninstalled.

```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | where {$_.Name -match "Exchange"}
```

Install the newest version. Check [here](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/3.7.2) to see the current version. Optionally, you can also skip the RequiredVersion parameter.


```powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -RequiredVersion 3.6.0

Import-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -MinimumVersion 3.0.0 -Force
```
