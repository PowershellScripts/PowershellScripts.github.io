A content type can be a form, a document template you want to use to gather information. Behind the scenes, a content type in SharePoint is a reusable collection of metadata (columns), workflows, and behavior settings for items in a list or library. Here is a step-by-step guide to create a content type in SharePoint Online.


# List or Library

First of all, make sure you have [enabled content type management](https://powershellscripts.github.io/articles/en/spo/enablect/) in your library.
