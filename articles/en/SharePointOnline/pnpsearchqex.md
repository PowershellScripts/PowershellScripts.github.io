# Intro

KQL (Keyword Query Language) is a powerful syntax used primarily within Microsoft products like SharePoint and Microsoft Search to formulate search queries. Understanding its basic rules and operators such as `AND`, `OR`, and other principles is crucial for constructing effective search queries. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of these rules:

<br/>

## Boolean Operators:

- **AND**: The `AND` operator is used to narrow down search results by requiring that all specified conditions must be met. For example, `ContentType:Document AND Author:"John Doe"` retrieves documents authored by John Doe.

- **OR**: The `OR` operator broadens search results by retrieving items that match either of the specified conditions. For example, `ContentType:Document OR ContentType:Folder` retrieves both documents and folders.

- **NOT**: The `NOT` operator excludes items that match the specified condition. For example, `ContentType:Document NOT Author:"Jane Smith"` excludes documents authored by Jane Smith.

<br/>

## Grouping:

- Parentheses `()` can be used to group clauses together to control the logical order of operations. For example, `(ContentType:Document OR ContentType:Folder) AND Author:"John Doe"` retrieves documents or folders authored by John Doe.

<br/>

## Wildcards and Fuzziness:

- **Wildcards**: KQL supports `*` (asterisk) as a wildcard character to match any sequence of characters. For example, `Title:proj*` matches documents with titles starting with "proj".

- **Fuzziness**: KQL allows for fuzzy matching using the `~` (tilde) followed by a number to indicate how many edit distance operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) are allowed. For example, `Title:proj~2` matches documents with titles similar to "proj" within an edit distance of 2.

<br/>

## Field Operators:

- **Field Specifiers**: Fields such as `Title:`, `Author:`, `ContentType:`, etc., specify which metadata or content property to search within. For example, `ContentType:Document` limits the search to documents only.

<br/>

## Range Queries:

- **Range Queries**: Using `..` (two dots) allows specifying a range for numerical or date fields. For example, `Modified:{Today-7}..{Today}` retrieves items modified within the last 7 days.

### Example Queries:

- **Simple Query**: `ContentType:Document AND Author:"John Doe"`
- **Complex Query**: `(ContentType:Document OR ContentType:Folder) AND (Author:"John Doe" OR Author:"Jane Smith")`
- **Wildcard Query**: `Title:proj*`
- **Fuzzy Query**: `Title:proj~2`
- **Range Query**: `Modified:{Today-30}..{Today}`

<br/>

## Usage Notes:

- **Syntax Sensitivity**: KQL syntax is case-insensitive but syntax structure (e.g., `AND`, `OR`) is crucial for correct query interpretation.
- **Managed Properties**: Ensure fields used in queries (`ContentType`, `Author`, etc.) are properly configured and indexed in your search system.
- **Testing**: Always test complex queries in a controlled environment to ensure they retrieve expected results.

# Examples

<br/>


## * Search for Documents Modified in the Last 30 Days
```kql

- `Author:{User.Name}`: Filters to show items where the author is the current user.

<br/>

## * Search for Items Modified by Current User
This shows items on which the user has worked.
