# Intro

In SharePoint Search, especially when using the PnP (Patterns and Practices) Search Web Part, you can use the KQL (Keyword Query Language) query template to build dynamic queries. The query template allows for conditional logic using tokens and variables, but it's not as straightforward as using traditional programming "if" statements. Instead, you can achieve conditional logic by leveraging tokens like `{?{ }}` to include or exclude parts of the query based on conditions. 

By using the `{?{ }}` syntax in your PnP Search Web Part query template, you can introduce dynamic, conditional logic similar to "if" statements in programming.

This article gives a few examples of how you can use conditional logic in a query template.

<br/><br/><br/>

# Detailed explanation
Imagine, you want to modify the PnP webpart search query based on whether a user has provided a specific filter or not.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Open the PnP Search Web Part**:
   - Go to the SharePoint page where you want to configure the web part.
   - Edit the page and add or configure the "PnP - Search Results" web part.

2. **Edit the Query Template**:
   - In the web part properties, locate the "Search Query" or "Query Template" field.

3. **Use Conditional Logic in KQL**:
   - Use the `{?{ }}` syntax to conditionally include parts of the query based on the presence of a token or variable.

### Sample Query Template:
```kql
{searchTerms} {?{QueryString.FilterCategory}Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}}
```

#### Explanation:
- `{searchTerms}`: This placeholder is replaced by the user's search query.
- `{?{QueryString.FilterCategory}Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}}`: This conditional logic checks if `QueryString.FilterCategory` is present. If it is, it appends `Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}` to the query.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- `QueryString.FilterCategory`: This is a token that gets replaced by the value of a query string parameter named `FilterCategory` if it exists.
- `Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}`: This part of the query is added only if `QueryString.FilterCategory` is present.

### Additional Example with Multiple Conditions:
If you have multiple conditions, you can chain them using similar syntax:

```kql
{searchTerms} {?{QueryString.FilterCategory}Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}} {?{QueryString.FilterDate}Date:{QueryString.FilterDate}}
```

### Explanation:
- This query template checks for both `FilterCategory` and `FilterDate` query string parameters.
- It appends the respective conditions to the search query if the parameters are present.

### Applying Tokens and Variables:
Tokens and variables can be retrieved from:
- Query string parameters
- Current user's properties
- Page properties

### Using Tokens:
Here are some common tokens you might use in a query template:
- `{searchTerms}`: The search terms entered by the user.
- `{User.Name}`: The current user's name.
- `{User.Email}`: The current user's email.
- `{Page.Title}`: The title of the current page.
- `{Today}`: The current date.

### Putting It All Together:
Hereâ€™s how a more complex query template with multiple conditions might look:

```kql
{searchTerms} {?{QueryString.FilterCategory}Category:{QueryString.FilterCategory}} {?{QueryString.FilterDate}Date:{QueryString.FilterDate}} {?{User.Name}Author:{User.Name}}
```
