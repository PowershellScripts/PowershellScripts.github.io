To invite a user to a SharePoint library without sending an email, first, navigate to the library and open its Settings or Manage Access panel. Click Grant Access or Share, and enter the userâ€™s name or email address. Select their desired permission level (e.g., Read, Edit). Before finalizing, ensure to uncheck or disable the Notify by Email option. Once done, click Share or Grant Access, and the user will be granted access without receiving an email notification.
