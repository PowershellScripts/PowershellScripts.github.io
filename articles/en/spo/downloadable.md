When you create a link to a file in SharePoint using the standard method, it opens in the browser by default. To make the file downloadable instead, you can customize the link to trigger a download rather than opening the file. This can be done by adjusting the file's URL or using specific download settings in SharePoint.



Navigate to your library and select the file. Click on three dots (...) and select **Download**

In your browser click on the download icon open the **Download History**


<img src="/articles/img/downloadable2.png" width="600" alt="screenshot showing a SharePoint library"><br/>


Copy the link from your download history:
