# Run As Admin

Managing roles and permissions is a critical part of administering Microsoft 365 environments. To ensure roles are assigned and configured correctly, the "Run As" feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center allows administrators to simulate and test various admin roles. This powerful functionality helps identify gaps in permissions, validate access levels, and streamline role-based configurations without affecting the live environment. Using Run As feature for admin accounts, you can simulate their access and test the permissions before assigning them.
