# Run As Admin

Managing roles and permissions is a critical part of administering Microsoft 365 environments. To ensure roles are assigned and configured correctly, the "Run As" feature in the Microsoft 365 admin center allows administrators to simulate and test various admin roles. This powerful functionality helps identify gaps in permissions, validate access levels, and streamline role-based configurations without affecting the live environment. Using Run As feature for admin accounts, you can simulate their access and test the permissions before assigning them.

Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center and select **Role Assignments** tab. You will see a list of admin roles, such as AI Administrator, Knowledge Manager, Global Reader, SharePoint Administrator, Viva Pulse Administrator or Virtual Visits Administrator

Because there are currently ??? admin roles at the time of writing this, you can easily sort them by category

Filter or search by name:

<br/><br/><br/>

Once you have selected the admin role to test, click on **Run As** . It will redirect you to a new browser tab, where you will be able to navigate through your Microsoft 365 tenant as the selected admin role. Mind you, all changes made to your tenant settings during that test will remain.
